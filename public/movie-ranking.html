<h3>Arcane</h3>
<p>Stunning animation. Captivating storytelling. Compelling characters. Absolute Cinema.</p>
<h3>Frieren: Beyond Journey's End</h3>
<p>Takes an amazing spin on normal animes: the story begins after the Demon King is defeated.
You will be venturing with Fieren to explore how a thousand-year old elf started to appreciate
life after just a short 10 years with her companions.

<p>A very fast-paced, complex movie that asks you to question the reality of your life.</p>
